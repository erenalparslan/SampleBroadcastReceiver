A Broadcast Receiver is an event-based component in Android that is used to respond to notifications or events broadcasted by other applications or the system. 
It captures a specific message that has been broadcasted and processes it to perform appropriate actions.

<li/>System Notifications: They are used to respond to system notifications sent by the Android operating system. For example, monitoring low battery level warnings, network state changes, screen unlock notifications, and taking appropriate actions based on them.

<li/>Broadcasts: They capture custom broadcasts sent by other applications or the system. This allows responding to specific events sent by other applications. For instance, capturing events when the camera button is pressed, internet connectivity changes, or when a custom broadcast is sent, and performing specific tasks accordingly.
